### Template 1: Blowout Forums Post

**Title:** Looking for Sports Card Shop Owners - Free App Beta (Trade-In Membership Program)

**Post:**
```
Hey everyone,

I'm building a Shopify app called TradeUp that helps card shops run membership programs with tiered trade-in rates (think GameStop PowerUp but for YOUR store).

Example: Bronze members get 50% of TCGPlayer market value, Gold members get 70%.

Looking for 10 shop owners to beta test for FREE:
- Get the Pro tier ($99/mo) free for 3 months
- Shape the product with your feedback
- 50% lifetime discount after beta

What the app does:
- Set up membership tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold or custom)
- Members see their tier and benefits in a portal
- Track trade-in history per member
- Syncs with Shopify customers

Requirements:
- Must have a Shopify store
- Willing to give honest feedback (good or bad)
- Can leave an App Store review after 2 weeks

If you're interested, reply here or DM me. Happy to jump on a call to show you a demo.

Thanks!

### Template 2: Facebook Group Message

**For:** Sports Card Shop Owners groups

```
Hi [Name]! 👋

I noticed you run [Shop Name] - nice collection!

I'm building a Shopify app for card shops that lets you set up membership programs with tiered trade-in rates. Think GameStop PowerUp but for independent shops.

Looking for a few beta testers to try it free for 3 months ($99/mo value). You'd get:
- Bronze/Silver/Gold tier system (or custom)
- Member portal customers can access
- Trade-in tracking
- Direct line to the developers

In exchange, just honest feedback and an App Store review.

Would you be interested in checking it out? Happy to do a 15-min demo call.

Hey! I saw your posts about running a card shop.

Building a Shopify app called TradeUp that helps shops like yours set up membership programs with tiered trade-in rates (50% for Bronze, 70% for Gold, etc).

Looking for beta testers - completely free for 3 months. Interested in checking it out?

No pressure either way, just thought it might be useful based on your posts.

### Template 4: Direct Email to Card Shops

**Subject:** Free beta: Trade-in membership app for [Shop Name]

```
Hi [Name],

I found [Shop Name] while researching card shops on Shopify and thought you might be interested in something I'm building.

TradeUp is a membership app that lets you offer tiered trade-in rates to customers - like GameStop PowerUp but for YOUR store.

How it works:
• Set up tiers (Bronze 50%, Silver 60%, Gold 70%)
• Customers see their tier and benefits in a member portal
• You track trade-in history per member

Looking for 10 beta testers:
• FREE Pro tier ($99/mo) for 3 months
• Shape the product with your feedback
• 50% lifetime discount after beta

Would a 15-minute demo call work this week?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Built by a fellow card shop owner (ORB Sports Cards) who wanted this for my own store.

Hey [Username],

I noticed you own/run a card shop. Quick question - do you offer trade-in rates to customers? And if so, do you have a membership program for it?

I'm building a Shopify app that helps shops set up tiered memberships (Bronze gets 50% of market value, Gold gets 70%, etc). Looking for beta testers.

Completely free for 3 months if you're interested. Just need honest feedback and an App Store review.

Let me know if that sounds interesting!

## Objection Handling

**"I don't do trade-ins"**
→ "That's fair. Do you ever buy collections? This could help you track those purchases and build loyalty with sellers."

**"My customers wouldn't use a membership"**
→ "The app makes it transparent - they just see 'I'm Gold tier, I get 70%.' No sign-up friction. Most see a 20%+ increase in repeat trade-ins."

**"I'm not on Shopify"**
→ "We're Shopify-only right now. If you're considering switching, we'd be happy to help with that too."

**"I don't have time"**
→ "Setup takes 5 minutes - you just pick a template (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and you're live. Happy to set it up on a call with you."

**"What happens after the beta?"**
→ "You keep your 50% lifetime discount. Pro tier is normally $99/mo, you'd pay $49.50/mo forever."
