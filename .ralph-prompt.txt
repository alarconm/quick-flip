Continue the Ralph autonomous loop. Read prd.json and progress.txt to understand current state.

Your task:
1. Find the FIRST story where "passes" is false
2. Implement that ONE story completely
3. Run tests to verify
4. Update progress.txt with what you did
5. Commit the changes with message "feat: [story-id] - [description]"
6. Update prd.json to mark the story as "passes": true

If ALL stories have "passes": true, output exactly:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Work autonomously. Do not ask questions. Make reasonable decisions.
